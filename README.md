# Code from my time at CWRU

- Although this code is public, please do not use it without my _explicit_ permission
- Code should be labeled in their respective folders, with Java Projects in their own folders as well, obviously

I am pursuing a Computer science minor, so I will not be taking as many advances computer science courses as other students...
That being said, I generally have a good time coding and love teaching myself skills that I find interesting, so there may be a lot of 'random' projects and files in the MISC folder. Currently, I exclusively use Visual Studio Code, but there is a chance there will be some weird files from DrJava in CSDS132. 
_Also, all code in the CSDS132 folder is designed to run with Java 8, and I used Amazon Correto as my JDK to accomplish this._

#### Note: the lib folder contains the necessary .jar files for using JUnit in VS Code

Whoever you are, I'm glad you're here and I hope you have/had a great day today <3
