# Code from my time at CWRU

- Although this code is public, please do not use it without my _explicit_ permission
- Code should be labeled in their respective folders, with Java Projects in their own folders as well, obviously

I am pursuing a Computer science minor, so I will not be taking as many advanced computer science courses as other students...
That being said, I generally have a good time coding and love teaching myself skills that I find interesting, so there may be a lot of 'random' projects and files in the MISC folder. Currently, I exclusively use Visual Studio Code, but there is a chance there will be some weird files from DrJava in CSDS132. I have since started learning VIM motions, and sometimes use neovim for basic text editing. 

I have started using maven as my go-to project manager. I also use the very popular Java RedHat Plugin for syntax highlighting and much more. Sometimes, the plugin breaks and reports package issues that aren't there. I am unsure if this is a reliable fix, as it has only worked the one time I tired it, but the following algorithm worked:
Remove source path configurations from settings.json $\to$ Reload Developer Window in Command Pallette $\to$ Replace removed config in settings.json.

This worked once, and I'm hoping this works when this issue occurs in the future.

Whoever you are, I'm glad you're here and I hope you have a great day today <3
