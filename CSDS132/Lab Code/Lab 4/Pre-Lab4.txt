DrJava Code can be found below:
public class PreLabFour {
  public String compareValues(int x, int y) {
    if (x > y) {
      return x + " is larger than " + y;
    }
    else if (y > x) {
      return y + " is larger than " + x;
    }
    else {
      return "the two values are equal";
    }
  }
}

Interactions Pane input and their outputs below:
> PreLabFour tester = new PreLabFour()
> tester.compareValues(2,1)
"2 is larger than 1"
> tester.compareValues(1,2)
"2 is larger than 1"
> tester.compareValues(2,2)
"the two values are equal"

An else statement is used here because if one of the values is not greater than the other, then the values must be equal.
